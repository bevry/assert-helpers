## v4.7.0 2018 December 19

-   `package.json:types` is now a declaration file instead of a source file
-   Updated [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base) and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v4.6.0 2018 December 4

-   Rewrote in TypeScript.
-   Inspect now defaults the depth to `50` instead of enforcing it.

-   Internal changes:
    -   `diffstrings` and `diffObjects` have been merged into `diff`, which on object types will use object comparison, otherwise it will use inspection comparison (before it would be a nooop on anything besides objects and strings)
    -   `logComparison` now uses `compare` which uses `diff`
